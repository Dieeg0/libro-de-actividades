PowerShell

PowerShell is an object-based shell.
Imagine a Unix shell (bash, Korn shell, etc.) that passes around .NET objects.


In many ways, PowerShell is a best-of-both-worlds synthesis of Windows and Unix culture.
It was developed at Microsoft by former Unix developers.
The core of the PowerShell language is based on the IEEE POSIX 1003.2 standard
for Unix shells. But where Unix shells pipe text between commands,
PowerShell passes .NET objects. That means instead of having to tease apart
text to extract the information you want, you can simply access methods
and properties of objects. It takes a while to realize just how powerful this is.

Because PowerShell is built on .NET, you can access the full functionality of the .NET framework from PowerShell just as you would from C# or VB.NET. But in addition, PowerShell wraps previous Microsoft object models such as COM and WMI in a consistent way so you can mix these objects together without paying a great deal of attention to where the objects originated.
